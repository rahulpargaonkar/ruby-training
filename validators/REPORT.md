## Grades

### Following TDD principles

D

There is no TDD done. It is impossible to trace the evolution of your thought process

There is a small amount of iteration and refactoring done (Hence the D not E)

### Pass Rate

A

All specs pass

### White box analysis

C

There are 3 big items to fix. Incosistencies in the style is the biggest concern. But we also need to remove
unrequired code and code that isn't self descriptive

### Overall Grade

B

You just scraped a B grade, but please spend a **lot** of time heeding the material. A lot of the requested info
was missing and as such you score low for the important items
